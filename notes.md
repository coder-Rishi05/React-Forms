### Notes

on submitting form react got reloaded which is not right approach as we dont want to reload our page if we are using react.

There are three ways to handle forms in react these are : 

1. useRef
2. controlled components.
3. REACT HOOK FORM (Most used way.)


### useRef 

```
In this method we select each input and take their values when form is submitted.

by useRef we can select any html input.
